# Jokes App

First Angular 5 application that displays jokes. This app introduces the concept of Components, Modules, 
and String Interpolation

## Code Structure

* `systemjs.config.js` - configuration file for systemjs which handles module loading and compilation of ts to js files
    * This app uses `SystemJS` as the module loader. Similarly webpack is widely as a command-line alternative.
* `script.ts` - typescript file 
* `tsconfig.json` - configuration for transpiler which converts above TypeScript file into JavaScript
